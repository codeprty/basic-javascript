# JavaScript Fundamental Exercises

This project is a collection of simple **beginner-friendly JavaScript exercises**.
Each file contains **10 basic exercises** focused on one fundamental topic.
These exercises are designed and tested using **Visual Studio Code**, and can be run in the terminal with **Node.js**.

The purpose of this project is to help beginners **practice essential JavaScript concepts** and **build a strong foundation** before moving on to more advanced topics.

**Note:** This project is ongoing. More exercises are being added regularly to cover additional fundamental JavaScript concepts.


## Project Structure

The project contains 14 JavaScript files (and counting), each covering a different topic:

| File Name        | Topic              | Description                                                              |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| exercise_01.js   | Variables          | Declaring variables with let/const, swapping, basic arithmetic.          |
| exercise_02.js   | Operators          | Arithmetic, assignment, comparison, range checks.                        |
| exercise_03.js   | If Statement       | Single-branch conditions for numbers, age, strings.                      |
| exercise_04.js   | If-Else            | Two-branch conditions like even/odd, login, temperature.                 |
| exercise_05.js   | If-Else-If         | Multi-branch conditions: grades, ranges, BMI, discounts.                 |
| exercise_06.js   | Switch             | Handling multiple options: days, months, traffic lights, letters.        |
| exercise_07.js   | Ternary Operator   | Concise conditions using "? :" for checks & decisions.                   |
| exercise_08.js   | Booleans           | Boolean values, logical operations, conversions.                         |
| exercise_09.js   | Logical Operators  | Combining conditions with &&, ||, ! for validation and access.           |
| exercise_10.js   | For Loop           | Counting, reversing, summing, iterating arrays/strings.                  |
| exercise_11.js   | While Loop         | Same as for loop but using while loops.                                  |
| exercise_12.js   | Do-While Loop      | Same as while loop, executes at least once.                              |
| exercise_13.js   | Break              | Stop loops early using the break statement.                              |
| exercise_14.js   | Continue           | Skip iterations in loops using continue.                                 |


## How to Run the Exercises

The exercises are written in JavaScript and can be run using **Node.js** in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

1. **Check if Node.js is installed**
   Open the terminal in VS Code and run:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   - If you see a version number (e.g., v22.18.0), Node.js is already installed.
   - If you get an error or nothing shows, you need to install Node.js.
3. **Install Node.js (if not already installed)**
   - Download and install Node.js from: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
   - After installation, run **node -v** again to confirm it is installed.
4. **Open the project in VS Code**
   - Navigate to your project folder and open it in VS Code.
   - Open a terminal inside VS Code (**Terminal > New Terminal**).
5. **Run an exercise**
   - In the terminal, run a specific JavaScript file with Node.js:
     ```bash
     node exercise_01.js
     ```
   - Replace **exercise_01.js** with the file you want to run (e.g., **exercise_02.js**).
6. View output
   - The results of the exercise will be printed in the terminal.
   - Modify the code or try different exercises to practice and see results in real-time.
